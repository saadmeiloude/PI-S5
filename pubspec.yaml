# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:
  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/Medicine-hom.png
    - assets/Medicine-cuate.png
    - assets/Sign up-rafiki.png
    - assets/Design tools-amico.png
    - assets/Authentication-cuate.png
    - assets/Reset password-bro.png
    - assets/
    #   - assets/images/
    #   - assets/icons/
    #   - assets/fonts/

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this flutter section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Cairo
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo-Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #   - family: Amiri
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: assets/fonts/Amiri-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: assets/fonts/Amiri-Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
